        "### 优化方法\n",
        "针对原始代码，主要进行了以下优化：\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **SIMD 优化：**\n",
        "   - 使用 AVX 指令集中的 `_mm256_loadu_ps` 和 `_mm256_mul_ps`，实现矩阵行和向量的分段计算（一次处理 8 个浮点数）。\n",
        "   - 添加水平加法归约函数 `horizontal_add_ps`，将 SIMD 计算结果转化为标量值。\n",
        "   - 提高了内循环计算密度，显著降低了每次点积运算的执行时间。\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **OpenMP 并行优化：**\n",
        "   - 外层循环继续使用 OpenMP 进行多线程并行化，充分利用多核 CPU。\n",
        "   - 使用 `schedule(static, chunk_size)` 明确分配任务块，避免线程调度开销。\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **分块优化：**\n",
        "   - 按行分块处理矩阵，减少数据在内存与缓存之间的交换，提升缓存命中率。\n",
        "   - 设置块大小为 64 行，适配 CPU 缓存特性。\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **内存对齐优化：**\n",
        "   - 使用 `_mm_malloc` 分配 32 字节对齐内存，为 SIMD 加载操作提供最佳性能。\n",
        "   - 避免了非对齐加载导致的性能损失。\n",
        "\n",
